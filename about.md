Hello!

I am Sukrit Bhatnagar, currently pursuing M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I also work as a System Administrator (RA) for my department. My current areas of interest include systems and virtualization.

My preferred languages are C (:heart:) and bash. I am an avid Linux user and like doing system (and kernel) programming mostly.

Apart from that, I am an [RHCA](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhca) (Red Hat Certified Architect) since May 2015, and have experience in playing with some Red Hat servers technologies such as RHEL, OpenStack, RHEVH, RHGS and JBoss. I am currently playing with Ansible.

I have also been accepted into GSoC'18 (Google Summer of Code) under [libvirt](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4775809127022592/#4704058003161088).
